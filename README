double.x

This program assemble two orthogonal cell together with a vacuum.
These two cell should have the same number of species.
----------     -----------
|POSCAR_1|     |         |
|vacuum  |  => |SPOSCAR_*|
|POSCAR_2|     |         |
----------     -----------

input file  :     input.dat  POSCAR_1  POSCAR_2
output file :     SPOSCAR_*

Along which axis should be specifed in 'axis'. 1, 2, 3 for x, y, z.
Number of species should be specifed in 'nspecies'.
Number of vacuum thickness should be specifed in 'ndelta'.
Vacuum thickness should be specifed in 'delta'.

!!! All key words should be in lower case

Orthogonality judgment:
  nondiagonal elements should be less than minl(in paramenters.f90).
